The first piece of news for the newsletter is a new PanDA website, namely this one. 
In addition to hosting the newsletter, the site gathers and updates material to offer a comprehensive and concise first point of contact for PanDA. Here you will find an overview of PanDA itself, with pointers into the most important PanDA twiki pages for more information; a BigPanDA Project page (needs improvement); pages gathering information on PanDA's application in experiments (ATLAS and LSST thus far); and publications and press lists. If you're a PanDA contributor please contribute to improving and updating this site. It's as easy as committing PanDA code.
