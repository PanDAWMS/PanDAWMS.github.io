The PanDA Production ANd Distributed Analysis system has been developed since summer 2005 to meet the ATLAS Experiment's requirements for a data-driven workload management system for production and distributed analysis processing capable of operating at LHC data processing scale. ATLAS processing and analysis places challenging requirements on throughput, scalability, robustness, efficient resource utilization, minimal operations manpower, and tight integration of data management with processing workflow.

PanDA was initially developed for US based ATLAS production and analysis, and assumed that role in late 2005. In October 2007 PanDA was adopted by the ATLAS Collaboration as the sole system for distributed processing production across the Collaboration. It proved itself as a scalable and reliable system capable of handling very large workflow. In 2008 it was adopted by ATLAS for user analysis processing as well.

PanDA throughput has been rising continuously over the years, showing excellent scalability. In 2009, a typical PanDA processing rate was 50k jobs/day and 14k CPU wall-time hours/day for production at 100 sites around the world, and 3-5k jobs/day for analysis. In 2015, PanDA processes close to a million jobs per day, with about 150k jobs running at any given time, peaking at about 200k. The PanDA analysis user community numbers over 1400. ATLAS PanDA processes more than an Exabyte of data each year. The system is expected to easily meet the growing needs over the next decade, albeit not without change and evolution, in the back end databases for example. PanDA evolution is continuous in order to cope with evolving requirements and use cases.

## PanDA Support

US ATLAS has supported PanDA development since PanDA's inception in 2005.

DOE ASCR and DOE HEP funded the proposal "A next generation workload management and analysis system for big data", beginning in 2012, with lead PIs Alexei Klimentov (BNL) and Kaushik De (UTA).
